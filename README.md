Adjustable timers and score tracking system.

5. Flight Control Board

4-layer PCB design for flight control applications.

Microcontroller-based sensor integration (MPU9250, BMP280, GPS, EEPROM).

Power management with NCP718 and MP1584 voltage regulators.

UART, SWD, BOOT, and ESC connections.

Designed using Altium Designer with comprehensive DRC and ERC checks.

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use?

Each project is stored in its respective branch along with the relevant design files. To access a specific project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>

# Switch to the desired project branch
git checkout <branch-name>
```

You can open the schematic and PCB designs using Altium Designer and compile the firmware to run on the respective hardware.
